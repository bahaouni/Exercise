Problem Statement
building a social network app where users must provide a fixed set of attributes when joining the app. The app will automatically group users based on these attributes, but the grouping should not require an exact match of all attributes. Rather, users should be grouped based on a subset of matching attributes.

User Attributes Example:
User 1: {Software, Engineer, Brussels, Belgium, Senior}
User 2: {Software, Engineer, Gamer, Senior}
Both users have some common attributes, such as "Software", "Engineer", and "Senior", and thus, they should be grouped together, even though their other attributes (like "Brussels" and "Gamer") differ.

Solution Overview
This application implements a grouping system where:

Users are assigned a unique ID when they join the app.
Users specify a set of attributes upon registration.
The system automatically groups users with matching attributes, where at least a subset of the attributes must match.
If no matching group exists, a new group is created for the user.
Users can view all other users in their group via an API.
Key Features
Signup: Users provide a set of attributes upon registration.
Signin: Users can sign in and get a token for subsequent requests.
Get Group: Users can see all the users in their assigned group.
Grouping Logic: Users are grouped based on matching attributes (with a configurable threshold).
Database Integration: PostgreSQL for persistent storage of users and groups.
Solution Design
Group Assignment Algorithm
Grouping Users:

When a new user joins, the system looks for existing groups that share a subset of attributes.
The assign_group function checks if a group exists that shares at least a specified minimum number of attributes (e.g., 3 attributes).
If no group matches, a new group is created.
Data Structure Used:

In-memory group_map: This dictionary stores group data to speed up the search for matching groups.
The keys are group_id values.
The values are sets of user attributes.
This allows efficient lookups and comparisons of user attributes against existing groups.
Database Integration:

SQLAlchemy is used to manage users and groups in a PostgreSQL database.
JSONB data type is used for storing user and group attributes in the database, allowing flexible and efficient querying.
Grouping Logic:

Each userâ€™s attributes are converted into a set to perform efficient set intersection operations.
The system then checks for overlapping attributes between the user's set and the sets of attributes already present in groups.
If the overlap exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 3 attributes), the user is grouped with the matching group.
Implementation
Database Models (SQLAlchemy)
python
from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import JSONB
from database import db

class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    attributes = db.Column(db.JSON, nullable=False)
    group_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('group.id'))  # Foreign key to Group

class Group(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    attributes = db.Column(JSONB, nullable=False)  # Stores group attributes as JSONB
Group Assignment Logic
python
def assign_group(user_id, attributes, minimum_matching_threshold=3):
    global group_map
    user_attributes_set = set(attributes)
    
    best_group = None
    max_matching_attributes = 0

    # Iterate over all groups in the group_map
    for group_id, group_attributes_set in group_map.items():
        matching_attributes = user_attributes_set & group_attributes_set
        match_count = len(matching_attributes)

        if match_count > max_matching_attributes and match_count >= minimum_matching_threshold:
            max_matching_attributes = match_count
            best_group = group_id

    # Assign user to the best matching group or create a new one
    if not best_group:
        new_group = Group(attributes=attributes)
        db.session.add(new_group)
        db.session.commit()
        group_map[new_group.id] = user_attributes_set
        group_id = new_group.id
    else:
        group_id = best_group

    user = User.query.get(user_id)
    user.group_id = group_id
    db.session.commit()

    return group_id
API Routes
python
@app.route('/signup', methods=['POST'])
def signup():
    data = request.json
    attributes = data.get('attributes', [])
    user = User(attributes=attributes)
    db.session.add(user)
    db.session.commit()

    assign_group(user.id, attributes)
    return UserSchema().jsonify(user), 201
Testing and Evaluation
Testing Approach
Unit Tests:
Ensure that users are grouped correctly based on overlapping attributes.
Verify that new groups are created when no suitable match is found.
Confirm that the group_map is updated when new groups are created.
Performance Tests:
Evaluate how the system scales by simulating high volumes of user signups with a variety of attributes.
Test Case Scenarios
Users with Identical Attributes:
Both users have identical attributes. Expect them to be placed in the same group.
Users with Partial Attribute Matches:
Users with some overlapping attributes (e.g., 3 common attributes out of 5) should be placed in the same group.
Users with No Matching Attributes:
A new group should be created for the user.
Users with Multiple Potential Matches:
The user should join the group with the highest number of overlapping attributes.
Why group_map was Chosen for Grouping
Efficiency: The group_map is an in-memory dictionary that maps group_id to a set of attributes. Using sets enables efficient set intersection, allowing the app to quickly check for matching attributes between users and groups.
Reduced Database Load: By storing the groups in memory, we reduce the number of database queries required for each new user. This is crucial for scalability, especially when there are a large number of users.
Scalability: For a large-scale application with millions of users, constantly querying the database for matching groups would be inefficient. Using an in-memory cache like group_map ensures that we can check for matching groups in constant time.
Scalability Considerations
In-Memory Group Map:

The group_map is suitable for handling moderate-sized datasets. For extremely large-scale applications, you can consider external caching systems like Redis or Memcached to store group data across multiple app instances.
Database Optimization:

For large datasets, indexing the attributes column in the database can speed up queries. PostgreSQL's JSONB index supports efficient querying of JSON attributes, which helps in searching for groups with similar attributes.
Queueing and Background Tasks:

Using Celery for background tasks (e.g., processing large batches of user signups or updating groups) can offload resource-intensive tasks from the main web request cycle, ensuring the app remains responsive.
Conclusion
This app efficiently groups users based on matching attributes and handles cases where no existing group meets the criteria by creating new groups. It uses an in-memory dictionary (group_map) to speed up group lookups and ensure efficient performance at scale. The system can be further optimized by integrating caching mechanisms like Redis and using background tasks for processing high volumes of user data.
